INSTALLING THE Modwheel-Apache2 BINDINGS

Installation of the modules is easy:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

After this you have to configure your apache server.
The Modwheel install script should have created an example
httpd.conf example to your Modwheel installation dir.
The file is named config/Modwheel-apache-example.conf and can also
be found in the config directory of this distribution.
Study this file and change it to fit your configuration, then add it to your
httpd.conf. Here is a list of what the new Apache configuration directives
means:


HANDLERS

PerlResponseHandler Modwheel::Apache2

    This is the main Modwheel handler. It requires that you have
    the ModwheelPrefix and ModwheelConfigFile options set.

PerlAuthenHandler Modwheel::Apache2::Authen

    This module is for authentication via the modwheel user system.


OPTIONS

PerlSetVar ModwheelPrefix
    This is the directory you installed Modwheel to.

    Example: PerlSetVar ModwheelPrefix "/opt/Modwheel"

PerlSetVar ModwheelConfigFile
    This is the Modwheel configuration file to use.
    If the filename is relative Modwheel will search for it in
    the ModwheelPrefix directory.

    Example: PerlSetVar ModwheelConfigFile "config/Modwheelconfig.yml"

PerlSetVar ModwheelSite
    The site to use. Sites are configured in the configuration file.

    Example: PerlSetVar ModwheelSite "SimpleAdmin"

PerlSetVar ModwheelFileUploads
    Users will be able to upload files to the site if this is set to Yes.
    This is used for the Repositories.

    Example: PerlSetVar ModwheelFileUploads Yes

PerlSetVar ModwheelWebPathToId Yes
    If this is set to yes, a user can enter i.e
        http://foo.bar/Music/Aphex Twin
    in his browser and Modwheel will find the node in the object tree
    with this name.

PerlSetVar Locale
    What language the site is in. For a list of the values that are possible
    with this directive you can enter this command: (if you are running a form
    of Unix):
        locale -a

    Example: PerlSetVar Locale en_EN

PerlSetVar DontHandle

    URL's that Modwheel should'nt handle for this site. This is meant for
    static content that does not need any content. i.e /images, /javascript
    and so on.

    Example: PerlSetVar DontHandle "rep javascript css images scriptaculous"

PerlSetVar NoDatabaseConnect

    Modwheel will not connect to the database if this is set to 'Yes'.

    Example: PerlSetVar NoDatabaseConnect Yes

PerlSetVar ContentType
    Set the content type for this site.

    Example: PerlSetVar ContentType "text/html"

PerlSetVar ModwheelFollowTemplates
    If a object has a user-specified template defined and ModwheelFollowTemplates
    is set to 'Yes', it will choose this template instead of the default.

    Example: PerlSetVar ModwheelFollowTemplates Yes
