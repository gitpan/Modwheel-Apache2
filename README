Modwheel-Apache is the Apache2+mod_perl bindings for Modwheel.

See the file config/modwheelapache.conf for a sample configuration file for running
Modwheel with apache2.

* Requirements
	Apache2							- http://httpd.apache.org
	mod_perl2						- http://perl.apache.org
	libapreq2						- http://search.cpan.org/~joesuf/libapreq2-2.08/

* Installation

Module::Install uses the standard perl module install process:

    cpansign -v         # optional; see SIGNATURE for details
    perl Makefile.PL
    make                # or 'nmake' on Win32
    make test
    make install

* Notes for Windows users

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will probably need the 'nmake'
utility before installation. It's available at:

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

If you are connected to the internet, "perl Makefile.PL" is capable
to automatically fetch it, and install into your windows directory;
all you have to do is to answer 'y' to this question:

    Required executable 'nmake' not found. Install it? [Y/n]:

However, if you are not yet online, or wish to install 'nmake' into
another directory, then please download the file manually, save it to
a directory in %PATH (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND), then launch the MS-DOS
command line shell, "cd" to that directory, and run "nmake15.exe" from
there; that will create the 'nmake.exe' file needed by CPANPLUS.

You may then resume the installation process above, but replace 'make'
with 'nmake' in the last three lines.
